# EasyMQTT
****composer require frmatias/easy-mqtt****

  - With this package you can connect your server to a mqtt cloud server, subscribe a topic and also publish a topic.


****Check the examples files****

`Library based on phpMQTT 
` Check the original work, i make the subscribe method more friendly and also removed some useless function, now you don't need call a callback funtion to receve the messenger returned from you server, that's work better for you when you are using a framework. 
The returned messenger from server is unprocessed so you need process ( i will improve ), there is useless method, but i'm trying rewrite everything again and after create a laravel package._
